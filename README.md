Updates to the github pages should follow [gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow), i.e.

* Any changes should be made in a branch off the **develop** branch. 
* When complete, changes can be merged into **develop** via a Pull Request.
* When ready to go "live" changes will be merged to master.
