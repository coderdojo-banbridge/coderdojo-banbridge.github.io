### What is Python?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages and is super concise, that means you can get the computer to do an awful lot with just a few lines of code! 

Many big computing companies, such as Google and NASA, use python and you can use it too with your own laptop, in a browser, and on your Raspberry Pi or micro:bit.

Python is a text based programming language, which means, unlike Scratch, it's made up of words, numbers and symbols (such as *, + & =)
