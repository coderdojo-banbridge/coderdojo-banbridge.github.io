### What is git?

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything 
from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

A version control system is a set of software tools that helps a software team manage changes to source code over 
time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a 
mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code! The database in git is
known as a repository.

### What is github?

GitHub is an online means of storing and sharing git repositories. It lets you and others work together on projects 
from anywhere. But it also provides so much more than that, even website hosting! The [CoderDojo Banbridge]
(http://coderdojo-banbridge.github.io) site is written in [github markdown]
(https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and hosted via [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)
