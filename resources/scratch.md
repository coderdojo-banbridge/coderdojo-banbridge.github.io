title: What is Scratch?
---
With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.

| Story Telling | Easier           | In Storytelling, students use computer science to tell fun and interactive stories. Storytelling emphasizes creativity by encouraging club members to tell a unique story each day.                                           |
| Art           | Moderate         | In Art, students create animations, interactive artwork, photograph filters, and other exciting, artistic projects.                                                                                                           |
| Music & Sound | Easier           | In Music & Sound, students use the computer to play musical notes, create a music video, and build an interactive music display while learning how programming is used to create music.                                       |
| Games Design  | More Challenging | In Game Design, students learn basic video game coding concepts by making different types of games, including racing, platform, launching, and more!                                                                          |
| Animation     | Advanced         | Students create fun and complex animated projects. This is an advanced curriculum, which means it teaches new concepts that are recommended for students who have already participated in at least two other CS First themes. |
