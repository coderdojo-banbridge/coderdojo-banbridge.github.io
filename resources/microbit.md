title: What is the micro:bit?
---

[micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a tiny programmable computer, designed to make learning and teaching easy and fun!

You can use your BBC micro:bit for all sorts of cool creations, from robots to musical instruments â€“ the possibilities are endless.

It can be coded from any web browser in Blocks, Javascript, Python, Scratch and more; no software required.

CoderDojo Banbridge were lucky enough to receive 10 micro:bit computers from the micro:bit educational foundation via the CoderDojo England and Wales team.

### CoderDojo Badges

The CoderDojo foundation currently do not  award specific badges for the micro:bit, but it can certainly be used as a tool to gain badges in [python](python.md)
