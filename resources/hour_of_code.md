### What is the Hour of Code?

The [Hour Of Code](https://hourofcode.com/uk) is a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science and is organised 
by [code.org](https://www.code.org)! Some of the biggest companies in the world have come together to support the 
Hour of Code, too â€” including Microsoft, Apple, & Amazon etc.

For our ninjas it's a great chance to try something for an hour that might be a bit _different_ to what they are 
already be tackling. It's also a great way for _new ninjas_ to get up and running with the creative would of programming.

The Hour of Code site has a load of [learning resources](https://hourofcode.com/uk/learn) that are great fun to tackle. When you complete them, you even get a printable certificate! Just a note that a lot of the information is based on US Grades but thankfully we have this information that shows how they [map to NI school levels](http://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/Sitedownloads/Miscpdfs/Gradetoage.pdf).
