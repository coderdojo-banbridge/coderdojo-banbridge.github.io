title: Welcome to CoderDojo Banbridge.
---

CoderDojo is a worldwide movement of **free, volunteer-led**, community-based **programming clubs for young people** typically aged between 7 & 17. Meets 11.30am - 1pm every 1st and 3rd Saturday of month. 

Take a look at our [resources](resources/index.md) to get an idea of some of the activities that can be tackled in or outside the dojo.

### Fundraising

The dojo is raising money to buy equipment & software licenses for the Dojo. You can contribute by one of the two avenues:

* [Deep River Rock](https://deepriverrock.ie/thirstforbetter/coderdojo-banbridge): If you are buying bottle of water, please consider Deep RiverRock's **#thirstforbetter** and support CoderDojoBanbridge - simply add the code from the bottle's label to [our page](https://deepriverrock.ie/thirstforbetter/coderdojo-banbridge) and RiverRock will donate 10p each time.

* [gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/coderdojo-banbridge): Our dojo has created a fundraising campaign to secure funds for some additional equipment & software licenses that we believe will further enrich our ninjas creative journey.
