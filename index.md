### Welcome to CoderDojo Banbridge.

CoderDojo is a worldwide movement of **free, volunteer-led**, community-based **programming clubs for young people** typically aged between 7 & 17. Meets 11.30am - 1pm every 1st and 3rd Saturday of month. 

Take a look at our [resources](resources/index.md) to get an idea of some of the activities that can be tackled in or outside the dojo.
